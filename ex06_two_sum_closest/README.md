# ex06_two_sum_closest

This exercise is part of the progressive algorithm series.

Open **exercise.py** and implement the function:

    def solve(username: str) -> None:
        """Compute and print the result for this exercise."""
        pass

Do **not** print extra text, only the final answer. Tests will call this function.
