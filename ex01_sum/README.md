## Exercise 1 — Sum from 1 to n

### Goal

Implement a simple accumulator loop and understand how to process a string parameter.

### Instructions

You receive a single string: `username`.
Its length is `n`.

You must compute:

```
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n
```

and **print the result**.

No spaces, no extra text, no explanation. Only the number.

### Example

If the username is:

```
a
```

Length = 1 → result = `1`

If the username is:

```
abcd
```

Length = 4 → result = `1+2+3+4 = 10`

Your output must be exactly:

```
10
```
